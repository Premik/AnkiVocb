Thomas and his friends.
They're two, four, six, eight.
Shunting trucks. 
Hauling freight.
Red and green and brown and blue.
The really Useful crew.
All with different roles to play.
Down the hills. 
Round the bends.

He's the cheeky one.
He always gets things done.
He's a friend of mine.
Is vain but lots of fun.
Pulls the mail on time.
Thunders down the line.
Really knows her stuff.
Toots and huffs and puffs.
Wants to help and share.
Let's say, he's square.
He is strong and tough.

Engines are on hand.
Waiting for a plane to land.
Be they diesels, be they steam.
Keep working as a team.
Will now go to bed.
And no one can remember.
The new one there.

Learned to help and share.
When there's a job. 
They're always there.
The engines have been working late.
All have roles to play.
