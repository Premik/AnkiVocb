Life is like a hurricane. 
Here in Duck - burg.
Race cars, lasers, aeroplanes.
It's a duck - blur.
Might solve a mystery.
Or rewrite history.
Every day they're out there.
Making Duck Tales.
Tales of daring-do. 
Bad and good luck tales.
Danger lurks behind you.
There's a stranger out to find you.
What to do.
When it seems. 
They're heading for. 
The final curtain.
Good deduction never fails.
That's for certain.
The worst of messes. 
Become successes.
Not ponytails or cottontails.
