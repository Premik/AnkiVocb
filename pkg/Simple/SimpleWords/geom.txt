There are no nonconvex Euclidean regular tessellations in any number of dimensions.

Polytope elements
The elements of a polytope can be considered according to either their own dimensionality or how many dimensions "down" they are from the body.

Vertex, a 0-dimensional element
Edge, a 1-dimensional element
Face, a 2-dimensional element
Cell, a 3-dimensional element
Hypercell or Teron, a 4-dimensional element
Facet, an (n-1)-dimensional element
Ridge, an (n-2)-dimensional element
Peak, an (n-3)-dimensional element
For example, in a polyhedron (3-dimensional polytope), a face is a facet, an edge is a ridge, and a vertex is a peak.

Vertex figure: not itself an element of a polytope, but a diagram showing how the elements meet.
Tessellations
The classical convex polytopes may be considered tessellations, or tilings, of spherical space. Tessellations of euclidean and hyperbolic space may also be considered regular polytopes. Note that an 'n'-dimensional polytope actually tessellates a space of one dimension less. For example, the (three-dimensional) platonic solids tessellate the 'two'-dimensional 'surface' of the sphere.

Zero dimension
Point
One-dimensional regular polytope
There is only one polytope in 1 dimension, whose boundaries are the two endpoints of a line segment, represented by the empty Schläfli symbol {}.
