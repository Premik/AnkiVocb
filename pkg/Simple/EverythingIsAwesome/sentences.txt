Everything is cool.
'cause everything is awesome.
Everything is better.
You know what's awesome?
Everything you see or think or say is awesome.
When you're part of a team.
You're living out a dream.
When we stick together.
Side by side. 
You and I are gonna win.
Let's party forever.
We're the same. 
I'm like you.
You're like me.
We are working in harmony.
Have you heard the news? 
Everyone's talking.
Life is good. 
Lost my job.
There's a new opportunity.
More free time. 
For my awesome community.
I feel more awesome. 
Than an awesome possum.
Dip my body. 
In chocolate frosting.
Three years later. 
Wash off the frosting.
Smelling like a blossom.
Stepped in mud. 
Got new brown shoes.
To win and to lose.
Blue sky.
Bouncy springs.
We just named two awesome things.
A nobel prize. 
A piece of string.
Dogs with fleas.
A book of greek antiquities.
Brand new pants. 
A very old vest.
Awesome items are the best.
