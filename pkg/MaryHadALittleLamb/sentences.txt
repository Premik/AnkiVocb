Mary had a little lamb,
Whose fleece was white as snow.
And everywhere that Mary went.
The lamb was sure to go.
He followed her to school one day.
Which was against the rules.
It made the children laugh and play.
To see a lamb at school.
And so the teacher turned him out.
But still he lingered near.
He waited patiently about.
Till Mary did appear.
Why does the lamb love Mary so?
The eager children cried.
Mary loves the lamb.
The teacher did reply.
