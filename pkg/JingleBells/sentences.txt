Dashing through the snow.
The horse was lean.
One-horse open sleigh.
Laughing all the way.
Bells on bob tail ring.
Making spirits bright.
To ride and sing.
To sing a song tonight.
What fun it is to ride.
Jingle bells.
Jingle all the way.
Sing the sleighing song.
A day or two ago.
The story I must tell.
I went out on the snow.
And on my back I fell.
Quickly drove away.
Was seated by my side.
A gent was riding by.
Quickly drove away.
The ground is white.
