Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way

Bells on bob tail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight!

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way.
Oh! what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way;
Oh! what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon, Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side,
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
He got into a drifted bank
And then we got upsot.

A day or two ago,
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow,
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls tonight
and sing this sleighing song;
Just get a bobtailed bay
Two forty as his speed[b]
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.

Dashing thro' the snow,
In a one-horse open sleigh,
O'er the hills we go,
Laughing all the way;
Bells on bob tail ring,
Making spirits bright,
Oh what sport to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight.

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way;
Oh! what joy it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

A day or two ago
I tho't I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fannie Bright
Was seated by my side.
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
He got into a drifted bank
And weâ€”we got upsot.


Jingle Bells Jingle Bells Lyrics:

Dashing through the snow, 
in a one-horse open sleigh. 
O'er the fields we go, 
laughing all the way. 
Bells on bobtails ring,
making spirits bright. 
What fun it is to ride and sing 
a sleighing song tonight. 

Oh! Jingle bells, jingle bells, 
jingle all the way. 
Oh what fun it is to ride 
in a one-horse open sleigh. 
Hey! Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way.
Oh what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh.

OK Everyone Together Now

Dashing through the snow, 
in a one-horse open sleigh. 
O'er the fields we go, 
laughing all the way. 
Bells on bobtails ring,
making spirits bright. 
What fun it is to ride and sing 
a sleighing song tonight. 

Oh! Jingle bells, jingle bells, 
jingle all the way. 
Oh what fun it is to ride 
in a one-horse open sleigh. 
Hey! Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way.
Oh what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh.
